# Berkshire-Hathaway
This project presents a UI/UX transformation of Berkshire Hathaway ink website with detailed before and after





CHALLENGES
1.Lack of Navigation: There is no "Global Navigation"
2.Dead-end Pages:Good UX ensures a user never feels "stuck."
3.The "PDF Trap":Most of the actual information (like Warren Buffett’s famous letters) is locked inside PDFs
4.Brand Perception:a new user might actually think they are on a fake website
5.Zero Visual Hierarchy: Everything is the same font (Times New Roman) and roughly the same size.
6.The site doesn't guide the user’s eye to what matters most.





SOLUTIONS 
1.Use different font weights, sizes, and colors to separate "News," "Investor Relations," and "Subsidiaries."
2.Implement high-contrast colors and a scalable typographic system.
3.Use a professional color palette ( Deep Navy, Slate Grey, Gold) to evoke the feeling of a high-end financial institution.
4.Sitemap "Investor Relations," "Company Letters," "Subsidiaries"
